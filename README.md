EAS + SIWE Enterprise On-Ramp Kit.

## From brainstorming

- **What**: Batteries-included package that gives Web2 teams Sign-In with Ethereum (EIP-4361), attestations (EAS) for KYC/roles/badges, plus policy enforcement.
- **Why it pays**: SaaS, agencies, and token-gated communities want it done right with security best practices.
